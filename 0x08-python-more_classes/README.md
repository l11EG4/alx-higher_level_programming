<h1>0x08-python-more_classes and Objects</h1>

<p>This repository contains Python files that demonstrate the use of classes and objects to work with rectangles and solve the N-Queens problem.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>0-rectangle.py</code>: This file contains the implementation of a simple <code>Rectangle</code> class without any functionality.</li>
  <li><code>1-rectangle.py</code>: In this file, the <code>Rectangle</code> class is extended to include a width and height with validation.</li>
  <li><code>2-rectangle.py</code>: The <code>Rectangle</code> class is further enhanced by adding methods to compute the area and perimeter.</li>
  <li><code>3-rectangle.py</code>: This file builds on the previous versions by implementing a representation of the rectangle using the <code>__str__</code> method.</li>
  <li><code>4-rectangle.py</code>: The <code>Rectangle</code> class is updated with the <code>__repr__</code> method, enabling a string representation of the rectangle object.</li>
  <li><code>5-rectangle.py</code>: In this file, the concept of a class attribute is explored by introducing a class variable for the number of rectangles.</li>
  <li><code>6-rectangle.py</code>: The <code>Rectangle</code> class is improved by adding methods to keep track of the number of instances created and destroyed.</li>
  <li><code>7-rectangle.py</code>: The <code>Rectangle</code> class is extended with a static method to compare two rectangles based on their areas.</li>
  <li><code>8-rectangle.py</code>: A new feature is added to the <code>Rectangle</code> class to create a new rectangle with dimensions scaled by a given factor.</li>
  <li><code>9-rectangle.py</code>: The final version of the <code>Rectangle</code> class includes a square subclass to represent square shapes.</li>
  <li><code>101-nqueens.py</code>: This file contains a Python program that solves the N-Queens problem, which aims to place N queens on an NxN chessboard without them attacking each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Open the desired Python file in your preferred editor or IDE.</li>
  <li>Run the Python script to see the demonstration of the classes and objects related to rectangles or the solution to the N-Queens problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine to execute the scripts.</p>
